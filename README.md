This repository is my personal collection of work and practice files where I’ve explored and applied advanced Excel formulas and tools. I built this as a way to sharpen my skills, experiment with different scenarios, and keep everything organized in one place.



What’s Inside:-

Excel files with solved examples

Practice sheets to try out formulas

Small datasets I used for testing



Topics Covered:-

This repository includes exercises and examples around:

Lookup formulas (VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, XLOOKUP)

Dynamic searches with INDEX & MATCH

Logical formulas (IF, AND, OR)

Text handling (LEFT, RIGHT, MID, LEN, TRIM, TEXTJOIN)

Date & time functions

Rounding and numeric formatting

Conditional formatting tricks

Pivot tables for summary reports




Why I Made This?:-

I wanted a simple place to keep track of everything I’ve learned about Excel. Instead of scattered files, this repository acts as a playground where I can experiment, make mistakes, and learn faster.



Open the Excel files in Microsoft Excel (2016 or later works best).

Explore each sheet, tweak formulas, and reuse examples for your own projects.



Note:-

All the data here is either manually created or randomly generated for learning purposes.

This is an evolving collection. I’ll keep updating it as I learn new tricks.
